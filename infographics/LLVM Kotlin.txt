Kotlin/Native harnesses the power of the LLVM infrastructure to "forge" high-performance, standalone native binaries. Kotlin source code is processed by the Kotlin/Native compiler into an intermediate representation, which is then intensely optimized within the central "LLVM Optimization Forge." This process eliminates the need for a virtual machine, ultimately producing direct machine code that delivers peak execution speed across a wide range of platforms, including iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, and WebAssembly.
